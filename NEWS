0.3.0
=====
Highlights:
    - A complete rewrite of Mousepad. The code is now written in GOjects
      where possible so we have a solid base for further development.
    - Run multiple windows in one instance. We also invoke a running
      instance with DBus (optional), this is needed for tab DND between
      windows.
    - Drag and Drop support for text inside a document, between tabs and
      between windows.  Also supports opening a file by dragging it into
      the window.
    - Support for multiple tabs in one window which are both reorderable
      and detachable.
    - Load multiple files at once from both the open dialog and the command
      line.
    - Type-ahead find and highlight feature like Firefox.
    - Support for editable menu accelerators.
    - Reimplemented recent file support. You can cleanup the Mousepad history
      and a file is removed from the history when Mousepad was unable to open
      it.
    - Syntax highlighting of many filetypes (including printing).
    - Various hidden settings.
    - Statusbar with filetype, cursor location and whether overwrite is
      actived.
    - Mousepad depends on GTK+ 2.20.
